Thanks to my friend Travis for being awesome and letting me use his property to film. Honestly this dude is awesome  ever time I go over there the lawn just gets destroyed  things catch fire that aren't supposed to  and hes just a generally cool guy  thanks Travis!

This is part 2 from my liquid metal bullets experiment! Last week we tested how these bullets preform by shooting them into a tank of water  this week we got to have some fun! We shot watermelons  cinderblocks  starting fluid  and a bunch more. Its a long video  but totally worth staying till the end because you get to see me choke on a bug haha.

The first test was shooting bullets at a watermelon. We shot Sodium  Potassium  and a special alloy of sodium &amp; potassium thats a liquid! Its basically the closest thing to shooting mercury out of a gun!
These bullets are insane! 

For this video I bought 150g of potassium for $325   and 500g of sodium for $150.  Each bullet holds 1g of metal. I also had to buy regular .45 hollowpoint ammo to modify ~.50c/bullet. At these prices  each potassium bullet costs $2.50 Each sodium bullet cost .80c. The liquid alloy is 25% sodium  75% potassium.


These bullets must be stored under dried and degassed solvent  blanketed in a dry  and inert atmosphere. Storing the bullets in regular oil or other hydrocarbon solvent will quickly destroy the entire bullet and casing in less than a week. Common oils and solvents are slightly permeable to oxygen and moisture which will react with the alkali metals to form corrosive hydroxides which will etch the zinc in the brass casing. Oil will enter the casing and inactivate the smokeless powder. After 1 week 1/10 of the bullets stored under oil did not fire.

DUmIDz5L0O8,Rocket Powered Fidget Spinner,"Join the science discord! https://discord.gg/pw5sZ3PTye Ok thats it  Fidget Spinner trend is over  cause this is the best one ever!! ;)  I built a custom fidget spinner out of 1/4in aluminum plate and strapped 3 E sized rocket engines.  

Really  I just wanted to do this. I saw Stephens video and needed answers. Plus  this gave me an excuse to buy a Plasma Cutter ive been eyeballing for yearssss. (dont tell sandra I could have made this with a jigsaw..)

The spinner has a 6 inch radius  so it travels ~37 inches to make a full circle.  Its spinning 88 times per second (5200 per minute)  so that means the tip is traveling 276 feet per second  or 188.182 MPH.  so yeah  1000mph fidget spinner is pretty much impossible... Who will accept my challenge?

Giant Air Plant information:
Its scientific name is Tillandsia utriculata. They are called 'air plants' because they typically live in trees. People sometimes think the name means they can survive air alone  but thats wrong! they still need water and nutrients (typically from decaying leaf litter they collect). They don't have a very high survival rate on the ground  and tend to die from staying wet for too long. Im just trying to raise awareness because I see people throwing them out or mowing over them all time time and there are very few left in my area.

Move over AntHillArt  theres a new guy in town! So today I decided I was going to pour molten aluminum on something. I just finished a new propane powered furnace and I wanted to put it to the test! 

I don't know why my brain jumped to watermelon  but I'm glad it did. What was going to be a way to waste the afternoon turned into an amazing discovery!

Those asking what it smelled like: Sickly sweet with base-notes of burning hair.

For those who say this is not science  I disagree. This experiment was a way to apply a lot of the things I learned throughout the years. I designed a burner for propane  and a special cement based refractory cement to withstand the heat.",32978007,132916,9004,5833,0

I got 4 gallons of bulk glue for mouse traps  because I was curious if a person could escape from a human-sized glue trap.
I never saw anybody try it before so I was curious. At first I thought about getting a few hundred of the regular sized glue traps from the store and stapling them to the plywood but decided the bulk glue would be more economical and cover more surface area.

IApUK_eu3Ek,Propane Rifle,"Join the science discord! https://discord.gg/pw5sZ3PTye Aloha fellow scientists! Have you ever seen anything so cool?  So after watching NightHawkInLight's video I knew I had to do this. It was easy to do  all I needed was a TS8000 torch  and 10 feet of 7/8 tubing from the hardware store.

Inspiration for this video NightHawkInLights video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXoqw-_uDx4

The torch is self-igniting  meaning it has an electric sparker built in. When the button is pressed halfway  the torch mixes a perfect combination of propane and air into the tube. When the button is fully pressed the torch sparks sending a flame flying through the tube. 

I tried to color the flame with some boric acid  and it turned bright green. NightHawkInLight gave me the idea to try powered charcoal to shoot embers and orange flame  worked great!

Well this experiment was not explody enough for me  so I used the same concept to build a propane powered cannon. This is honestly the best gas cannon I've ever used  it is just so simple. You could probably shoot 20 golfballs a minute the length of a football field or farther. The canon shot golf balls over 600 feet in the air!! 

Im sure you can do tons of other cool things with this concept  let my know if you want me to try something!

Plans for the cannon - http://imgur.com/aIvOtPj
Different torches  and if they will work - http://imgur.com/a/w6Ji8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 One important thing I forgot to mention in the video is the fit of the object in the barrel. If you completely plug the barrel the gas mixture does not enter the tube  because torch only 'passively' blows the mixture down the tube into the combustion chamber. All the projectiles i shot had some 'slack' in the barrel.

A few more thoughts on the Nerf Cannon.
Yes  I know if I used a longer barrel I could get higher speeds  but I did not want to deal with a 20ft long gun. I think a 6ft barrel was enough to show what a supersonic nerf dart can do. 

Davekni got a pingpong ball going 2000mph which is 2930 ft/s!! (mach 2.5). His barrel was 20ft long. It can shoot through 3/4in plywood! You can see that video here- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuwu4gjNbQ

I always thought the speed of sound was the limiting factor  because the flow 'chokes' at mach 1. Its a big controversy among air-gunners  and theres like a 900 post topic on it here https://www.gatewaytoairguns.org/GTA/index.php?topic=102604.540.  Some guy got one going like 2100 ft/s which I thought was impossible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUq4OQqZ2bw So it prompted me to do some research.

It turns out flow does choke at mach 1  but its only the mass flow that chokes. The gas can still expand supersonically.



Also a big thanks to Dr. Carl Knowlen from University of Washington  and u/Overunderrated   u/TheQueq  and u/InductorMan from reddit.





Here are the papers I referenced:

A COMPARISON OF DISTRIBUTED INJECTION
HYPERVELOCITY ACCELERATORS - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268456817_A_comparison_of_distributed_injection_hypervelocity_accelerators

Numerical Evaluation of a Light-Gas Gun Facility for Impact Test
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270629342_Numerical_Evaluation_of_a_Light-Gas_Gun_Facility_for_Impact_Test
Shows different muzzle velocities for different barrel lengths


THE THEORY OF HIGH SPEED GUNS
http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/475660.pdf
Probably the most extensive on the subject  The reader Is assumed to be an advanced student in engineering.  I hope you payed better attention in physics that I did.

aINlzgrOovI,Mark McMorris and Seb Toots Shred Custom Built Terrain Park | Uncorked,"‚ñ∫Click here to rethink the terrain park with Mark McMorris: http://win.gs/Uncorked
Technical features over technical tricks is the mandate for McMorris and Toutant‚Äôs new project  'Uncorked'. Mark McMorris and Sebastien Toutant are two of the best in the business of slopestyle snowboarding. They can go bigger and flip faster than us mere mortals will ever be able to  and they each have a bag o' tricks that go deep enough to keep them at the top of podiums around the world.

...But snowboarding's not always about the gnarliest tricks and mega kickers  and the boys aren't keen on progressing the sport to just become that. 'Uncorked' is their take on growing snowboarding through creative features  high speed shredding  and stomping classic tricks with the style and ease of a winter Sensei. So sit back and enjoy 'Uncorked'  and let it be a reminder to us all how much snowboarding fu**ing rules.

edfw9ip9sCQ,The Dawn Wall - Trailer,"‚ñ∫To watch the film  visit: DawnWallFilm.com
A Red Bull Media House Production in association with Sender Films

** Audience Award SXSW ** Official Selection IDFA ** Best Documentary Feature  Greenwich Int. Film Festival ** Best Mountaineering Film  Trento Film Festival ** Audience Award SF DocsFest **

In January  2015  American rock climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captivated the world with their effort to climb The Dawn Wall  a seemingly impossible 3 000 foot rock face in Yosemite National Park  California. The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks  igniting a frenzy of global media attention. But for Tommy Caldwell  The Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22  the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after  he lost his index finger in an accident  but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart  he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing The Dawn Wall. Blurring the line between dedication and obsession  Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt  with the world watching  Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream  or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?

FHtvDA0W34I,Felix Baumgartner's supersonic freefall from 128k' - Mission Highlights,"¬ª Jump into more adrenaline filled aerial action: http://win.gs/MoreAerial
After flying to an altitude of 39 045 meters (128 100 feet) in a helium-filled balloon  Felix Baumgartner completed a record breaking jump for the ages from the edge of space  exactly 65 years after Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier flying in an experimental rocket-powered airplane. Felix reached a maximum of speed of 1 357.6 km/h or 843.6 mph(Mach 1.25) through the near vacuum of the stratosphere before being slowed by the atmosphere later during his 4:20 minute long freefall. The 43-year-old Austrian skydiving expert also broke two other world records (highest freefall  highest manned balloon flight)  leaving the one for the longest freefall to project mentor Col. Joe Kittinger.

Before endurance and water sports existed  there was canoe paddling. Initially a vehicle used to hunt and fight has now become one of the largest growing fitness and endurance sports in the world. The U.S. outrigger canoe paddling team from Kona  the Red Bull Wa‚Äôa  have taken the age-old sport by storm and challenged the tenure of the Tahitian paddlers.  For the Red Bull Wa‚Äôa  paddling isn‚Äôt just a means to peak personal strength - it‚Äôs spiritual. Team captain  Kainoa Tanoai  says  When you‚Äôre paddling for four hours a day  you‚Äôre focused on the goal of competing at the highest level  but you‚Äôre also focused on being one with the ocean and respecting the canoe  your teammates  and the sport.

In January  2015  American rock climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captivated the world with their effort to climb the Dawn Wall aka El Capitan  a seemingly impossible 3 000 foot rock face in Yosemite National Park  California. The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks  igniting a frenzy of global media attention. But for Tommy Caldwell  the Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22  the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after  he lost his index finger in an accident  but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart  he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing the Dawn Wall. Blurring the line between dedication and obsession  Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt  with the world watching  Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream  or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?

‚ñ∫See more of the epic prank at http://redbull.com/QBprank 
Jared Goff may be a star QB for the Los Angeles Rams  but for one magical spring day  he was a transfer into the Ventura College football team in Southern California. In what could go down as the football prank of the year  Goff and the coaching staff at Ventura College tricked the team into believing he was the hot shot newcomer eyeing the starting QB job. Needless to say  the real quarterbacks on the roster were none too pleased!

Some may remember when Chicago Cubs baseball star Kris Bryant transferred into a community college back in 2016 to prank a team. This follows that same juicy plot  just in time for the NFL Draft of 2018. You‚Äôre welcome.

ezoZfZK75zA,The Physics and Speed of Fencing,"‚ñ∫ CLICK for more fencing stories on redbull.com: http://win.gs/RBFencing
How much do you know about fencing? For most people  it's not much ‚Äì a few seconds of quick moves  and a winner declared on the scoreboard. The speed of attacks and hits is so fast ‚Äì it's quite hard to follow with an untutored eye.

Ukrainian fencer Olga Kharlan not only understands what's happening in those seconds  but also excels at scoring winning hits. Fencing isn't about force. Rather  the ability to choose the right position and distance is the key. The faster fencer will 'step-lunge'  which offers more chances to land a hit first. The speed of this move made by professional athletes can be compared to the acceleration of a race car.

What if we put Kharlan next to Alexander Grinchuk‚Äôs 600hp #RedBull350z  which accelerates up to 100km in four seconds  on the starting line? You'd be surprised to see who's faster.

‚ñ∫What is Neymar Jr's Five?
It's the biggest global five a side football tournament! But there's little other comparison with regular five-a-side. In Neymar Jr's Five  there are no goalkeepers for a start  and every time someone scores their opponents lose one player  until 10 frenetic minutes are up or one team runs out of players. A draw leads to a one-on-one play-off situation to decide the result.
