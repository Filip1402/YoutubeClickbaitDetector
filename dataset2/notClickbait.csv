0MaeHNU2660,Why have SpaceX  Boeing & Blue Origin ditched abort towers?,"Want an article version of this video? Here you go! https://everydayastronaut.com/abort-towers/

There’s a new trend going around in the commercial space industry when it comes to launch abort systems. All three commercial companies who are putting abort systems on their crewed vehicles have ditched the classic launch abort tower we’ve seen dominate abort systems in the past.

Previous vehicles like the Mercury capsule  the Apollo capsule and even the Soyuz all used an escape tower that sat on top of the crew module  capable of pulling the vehicle away from a failing rocket in a hurry.

And to make this topic even more interesting  we’re seeing another trend in abort systems... SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s Starliner capsules both are using liquid fueled abort motors instead of solid rocket motors.

So today we’re going to talk about the design considerations that have made SpaceX  Boeing and Blue Origin ditch abort towers on their crewed vehicles and we’re also going to evaluate why the heck Boeing and SpaceX are going with liquid motors instead of solid motors. 

And with both Boeing and SpaceX having experienced serious setbacks and complications with their liquid fueled abort systems  including the loss of a test vehicle  it raises the question… is it even a good idea?....

kB-GKvdydho,Why do cylindrical rockets roll?,"Here’s a fun question that not only have I myself asked  but I get asked fairly often  why do we hear a call out like “roger roll” or “roll program complete” at which point we can see the rocket rotate or roll on its X axis…

The best example of this was the Space Shuttle which had a very obvious and dramatic roll program. As soon as it cleared the tower  you can see it making a very impressive and sometimes scary looking roll. 

Now a maneuver like this makes sense when a vehicle is asymmetrical like the Space Shuttle  but why do cylindrical rockets like the Saturn V  Titan  Atlas  Delta IV etc etc even bother doing a roll? 

Can’t rockets just tip over in whatever direction they need to go? Do a little pitch here  a little yaw there just as long as the pointy end is going the direction it’s intended to go  who cares which side of the rocket is facing the Earth and which side is facing space… right? 

So today we’ll first define the pitch  yaw  roll and their corresponding axis on a rocket  then we’re going to dive into why a rocket rolls in the first place  take a look at launch azimuths and their relationships to trajectories and we’ll look at some unique solutions to orientations including some rockets that don’t roll on ascent to align with their trajectory.

There’s nothing more exciting than a new rocket concept  a new mission to unknown worlds  or an exciting breakthrough technology. Unfortunately for every proposal there’s almost an equal amount of cancellations with only a small handful making it beyond the drawing board. 


What’s even more frustrating is when these concepts leave paper  have thousands of engineering hours put in  hardware gets built  billions of dollars invested and THEN it gets put on the shelf.

In this new series called “cancelled”  we’re going to take a look at space programs and concepts that were so close to complete and sometimes even launched before it got cancelled.

We’re at a really exciting time where the number of crewed vehicles going to the international space station will go from just one to three!. The Soyuz’s 8 year monopoly for getting humans to the ISS is coming to an end.

So today we’re going to take a deep dive on the two new spaceships that will be responsible for taking humans to and from the International Space Station from the United States. We’ll compare the Boeing Starliner riding an Atlas V rocket to SpaceX’s Crew Dragon on their Falcon 9 Rocket.

And to see how we’ve progressed in the world of human spaceflight  we’ll also compare all these systems along side Russia’s Soyuz capsule and the United State’s retired Space Shuttle in a side by side comparison.

We’ll look at the designs  the rockets they’ll ride  dimensions  cost  safety considerations  and any other unique features that each vehicle offers.

Considering I’ve been up close and personal with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Capsule  and Boeing’s Starliner  I’ve got some good insight on some of these vehicles.

9O15vipueLs,Can Starship Help Make The Artemis Program Better Than Apollo?,"NASA's making some big moves to finally get humans back to the moon for the first time in over 50 years. The Artemis program is shaping up with checks written and hardware built! So how does a 21st Century program to the moon compare to that of the 1960's?

In Today's video  we’re going to answer the question  why does NASA think Artemis will be a sustainable program when SLS is sooooo dang expensive AND it’ll take at least two launches to get humans and their lunar landers to the moon.

This CAN’T be more sustainable than Apollo  right? Well  we didn’t even begin to scratch the surface of the costs  so today we’re going to really dive into the total costs  including development  infrastructure and hardware by giving SLS and Orion a full cost audit.

But we’ll even show you how the Apollo program and Artemis mission profiles differ including the specific orbits and rendezvous and everything required to get humans to the surface of the moon and even talk about the upgraded safety considerations and hardware involved.

Once we look at all these details  we can answer the question  50 years later  is the Artemis program actually an improvement over the Apollo program or is NASA going completely in the wrong direction when returning to the moon?

Boeing’s spaceship is the CST-100 Starliner  a capsule shaped spacecraft that can fly up to 7 astronauts to space. For NASA missions to the International Space Station  it will fly up to 4 astronauts at a time  filling the rest of the capsule with cargo.

The Starliner will launch on top of perhaps the most reliable rocket ever made. ULA’s Atlas V with 2 strap on solid rocket motors and 2 RL-10 upper stage engines. A configuration that an Atlas 5 has never actually flown before  but all the hardware has been flown many times throughout history.

Today we’re going to look at the history of aerospike engines  go over how nozzles work including things like overexpansion  underexpansion and even expansion ratios  we’ll look at the pros and cons of the aerospike  the physical limitations and problems  then we’ll compare the aerospike to some other traditional rocket engines. 

But that’s not all  I obtained never seen before photos and videos of some aerospikes  we’ll get opinions from some people who have actually worked with aerospike engines  look at some promising prospects and compelling concepts and by the end of the video we’ll hopefully know whether or not the holy grail of rocket engines is just waiting to be utilized or if aerospikes just simply aren’t worth it.

he_BL6Q5u1Y,Why don't rocket engines melt? How engineers keep engines cool,"Rocket engines need to produce heat to function  after all  their only real purpose is to convert the chemical energy in the propellant into pressure and heat so they can produce thrust.

And that brings up an obvious question! How in the heck do engines survive this heat? How did rocket scientists figure out how to keep an engine running continuously while harboring combustion inside it that’s hot enough to melt the very walls that are containing it?!

Today we’re going to talk about the tricks engineers employ to keep rocket engines from melting. We’ll go over ablative cooling  regenerative cooling  film cooling  radiative cooling  heat sinks  and fuel to oxidizer ratios and show you some awesome examples of each.

WlQH3MHhm0Y,The Biggest BOOMS in Rocket History,"Space is hard. There’s a reason we use rocket science as a benchmark for anything extremely difficult. 

I for one champion all things space and eagerly await every single upcoming space event. But  in order to move forward  we’d better look back at some past failures and see what we’ve learned from them.

What better way to do that than to watch some of the biggest boom’s in spaceflight history? 

BUT as always on my channel  this isn’t just a random compilation of crazy explosions  nope sorry… 

I’ll be teaching you what went wrong and other random facts about each mission so we too can learn while we watch some fireworks….

After all  mistakes are only mistakes if you don’t learn anything from them. 

That being said  let’s see some of the biggest booms in rocket history!

-8p2JDTd13k,Complete Guide To Starship: Falcon 9 VS Starship. What's new? What's different?,"SpaceX is taking everything up a notch with Starship. This thing is the ultimate challenge in aerospace engineering  a FULLY and rapidly reusable super heavy lift launch vehicle  capable of taking 150 metric tonnes to low Earth orbit. 

But Starship’s ultimate goal goes way beyond just terrestrial orbital ambitions  Starship is the first vehicle designed to actually take human beings to Mars and back again.

In order to achieve this absolutely bonkers goal  SpaceX has had to employ a litany of new technologies  use new materials  develop the most advanced rocket engines ever made and come up with some wild ideas that have never been tried before… and maybe for good reason.

So today I wanted to go over all of these new technologies and compare it to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to help point out what things are new  what things are different and what they’ve learned from the Falcon family that will apply to Starship in order to really understand just how ambitious this project is.

We won’t be just scratching the surface here  in fact we’ll actually be taking you inside the rockets and showing you basically every single part and going over all of them with a fine tooth comb so you can learn as much as possible and have a definitive guide to Starship.

LbH1ZDImaI8,Is SpaceX's Raptor engine the king of rocket engines?,"00:00 - Intro
02:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines 
06:10 - Rocket engine cycles 
20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison
30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines
44:05 - Summary

Article version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823&preview=true

SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop  no engine like this has ever flown before! 

Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context  we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines  like SpaceX’s current work horse  the Merlin  The Space Shuttle’s RS-25  the RD-180  Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.

And if that’s not enough  not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle  they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel  again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.

We'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is  how it works  and how it compares to the other cycles.

So by the end of this video hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special  how it compares to other rocket engines  why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…

It's MASSIVE  has WAY TOO MANY ENGINES  and most Kerbal of all  it blew up every single time. 

Today we're going to show you how/why it failed and also how it SHOULD HAVE worked.. (hopefully).

Sfc2Jg1gkKA,Why Single Stage to Orbit rockets SUCK. The wacky history and future maybes of SSTOs,"Rockets are HUGE  complicated and expensive. As a matter of fact  the rocket that took humans to the moon  the Saturn 5  was 111 meters or 363 feet tall  and had more separation events than dating teenagers. 

So why do rockets always split themselves into multiple parts. Isn’t that complicated and risky? Why throw so much away? I mean  there’s got to be a better way!!!

Well how about if rockets were only ONE stage? How awesome would that be? Well this idea isn’t new… it’s called single stage to orbit or SSTO and it’s often considered the holy grail of rocketry.

Well  today  I’m going to SMASH THAT HOLY GRAIL and explain why I think SSTO’s SUCK. 

In order to drill this point in we’ll teach you all about the tyranny of the rocket equation and help you understand why every orbital rocket  well  ever is multistage. 

Then we’ll take a stroll down SSTO history and look at some crazy designs that in some cases almost worked...

And not to be a huge downer  we will take a look at some SSTO designs that MIGHT actually work  including the Skylon spaceplane that uses the awesome SABRE hybrid engine.

he_BL6Q5u1Y,Why don't rocket engines melt? How engineers keep engines cool,"Rocket engines need to produce heat to function  after all  their only real purpose is to convert the chemical energy in the propellant into pressure and heat so they can produce thrust.

And that brings up an obvious question! How in the heck do engines survive this heat? How did rocket scientists figure out how to keep an engine running continuously while harboring combustion inside it that’s hot enough to melt the very walls that are containing it?!

Today we’re going to talk about the tricks engineers employ to keep rocket engines from melting. We’ll go over ablative cooling  regenerative cooling  film cooling  radiative cooling  heat sinks  and fuel to oxidizer ratios and show you some awesome examples of each.

Rocket Lab just announced they plan to try and recover their Electron rockets using a parachute and a helicopter… Yeah  seriously.

Today we’re going to dive into Rocket Lab’s plans for reusability including some deep dives on the challenges they face including the forces and velocities. 

Then we’ll go into the history of air recovery  and compare Rocket Lab’s reusability plans to other space systems that utilize parachutes such as the space shuttle’s SRBs  the Falcon 9  SpaceX’s fairings  and even ULA’s similar plans they’re calling SMART reuse.

I also got exclusive information from Rocket Lab and Peter Beck himself with some exciting additional details on just how exactly they hope to do this.

y5LZECPm_HE,Substance Source Sportswear: Winter 2019 with Ronan Mahon | Adobe Substance 3D,"Ronan Mahon illustrates the Substance Source sports fabrics release.

The Substance team has kindly invited me to collaborate and give my take on their newest selection of textiles for Substance Source.

On seeing the collection I had a few exciting ideas I wanted to explore in Unreal. First  I wanted to show the artist’s journey as he or she opens and explores the pack. Secondly  I wanted to show the lightness  color and movement inherent in the collection.

Artists spend a lot of time experimenting! We often change our minds in the pursuit of beauty. You will see the fabric change shape  color and suggest the many different possibilities available. Time goes forward and backward in the video because  as an artist  I know it can be hard to settle on a final choice. Finally  the music has a snappy  pulsing  relentless beat - a bit like a loom weaving a new creation. 

To be approached as an artist and asked for my view was an honor - so thank you  Substance!

Extreme E is a competitive platform for accelerating the development of electric vehicles  to help create a low-carbon future powered by renewable energy. We are committed to supporting and partnering with organisations working to restore the degraded environments in which we race  the precious ecosystems within them and the people who live there.

Above all  we hope to raise awareness and inspire action to encourage every individual to come together and play their part to safeguard the future of the Earth and all its inhabitants.

H4em0XRlkdg,This dirty lead needs to be cleaned,"So today I'll be cleaning some really dirty lead. To do this  first I just have to melt it on a camping stove. When it's fully melted  lead oxide and other contaminants separate from pure liquid lead. Now I just have to carefully pour the liquid lead into water  and hopefully leave all of the contaminants behind.

GzCqZvOlNDk,Completely dissolving copper wire in acid,"Nitric acid is one of the few acids that can react with copper. But oddly enough  it doesn't work well when the acid is pure. This is because of something called passivation where layer of oxidized copper forms and it covers the surface and protects the copper. To get it going  I have to add some water  which will dissolve the protective layer and let the acid attack it. This more dilute acid can completely shred all the metal until it completely dissolves.

VjPQA8aXE_M,This reaction is hard to find (Briggs-Rauscher),"Today I've decided to do something  which I think kind of looks like magic. I'll need 3 solutions which I'll call A  B and C. Solution A contains sulfuric acid and potassium iodate. Solution B contains starch  malonic acid  and manganese sulfate. Finally solution C  is just hydrogen peroxide. Now when I mix them together something really cool happens. This is known as the Briggs-Rauscher reaction  and it's one of the very few oscillating chemical reactions.

GKmZsm192DI,How deadly is cyanide?,"Sodium cyanide is quite useful in chemistry  but it's probably best known as a poison. When used in chemistry  it can be a bit scary to work with because of its toxicity. However  what I find surprising  is that it still takes a decent amount for it to be dangerous.

WARNING: Cyanide is EXTREMELY toxic and dangerous. It was handled very carefully in this video. DO NOT recreate anything you see.

However tungsten is one of the densest metals  so a cube of the same size weighs over 5 pounds. It has almost the same density as gold  so a block of gold the same size would weight the same amount. I also have a 4x4 inch cube of tungsten and it's pretty crazy because it weighs 42 pounds.

Z6rhk95-FVU,Dropping a match into liquid oxygen,"So today  I'm going to be making some liquid oxygen. Oxygen is normally a gas  but it can be turned into a liquid using liquid nitrogen. It's a bit hard to see  but liquid oxygen is faintly blue. This is very dangerous  but what's fun to do  is to throw a match into it. As a liquid  oxygen is an even more powerful oxidizer and it can sometimes react explosively.

WARNING: Liquid oxygen is extremely dangerous. It's an extremely strong oxidizer and can react explosively.

This is commonly done to purify gold  and separate it from raw ore. What I think is fun though  is to just throw some pure gold leaf into it. As the mercury dissolves the gold  it's slowly pulled in  and it kind of looks like the mercury is eating it.
